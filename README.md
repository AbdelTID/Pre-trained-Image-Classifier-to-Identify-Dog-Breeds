# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds


### To succeed the project, our results must be the same as the Project results from [Udacity](https://learn.udacity.com/) show below

Given our results, the `best` model architecture is VGG. It outperformed both of the other architectures when considering both objectives 1 and 2. You will notice that ResNet did classify dog breeds better than AlexNet, but only VGG and AlexNet were able to classify `dogs` and `not-a-dog` at 100% accuracy. The model VGG was the one that was able to classify `dogs` and `not-a-dog` with 100% accuracy and had the best performance regarding breed classification with 93.3% accuracy.
